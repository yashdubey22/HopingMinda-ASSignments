                <h2>Start With Whole-Grain Cereal</h2>
                <br>
                <p>If you don't have enough to eat before you exercise, you may not have enough gas in the tank. You
                    might burn fewer calories, too. Have some healthy carbs at least an hour in advance of your workout.
                    Try a bowl of whole-grain cereal with skim milk and cut up fruit or some whole wheat toast or a
                    bagel, Cream cheese and butter add saturated fat.</p>

                <h2>Black Bean Burger</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Whether you sometimes try a meat-free meal or stick to a full-time vegetarian
                    diet, you can get plenty of protein (and lots of other nutrients, including fiber)
                    from plants. Try pinto, kidney, white, or black beans, split peas, or chickpeas,
                    Soy products, like tofu and tempeh, and nuts also have protein.</p>

                <h2>A Bowl of Berries</h2>
                <br>
                <p>After a workout, go for these instead of a bottle of juice. A lot of the fiber in
                    whole fruits is lost as they become juice. Blueberries, in particular, have been
                    shown to reduce muscle soreness from strenuous exercise. Cherries are another
                    good option. But any berry will likely help.</p>
