                <h2>What type of training should I do to lose weight?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>When it comes to losing weight, you and combination of weight/resistance trainning and cardiovascular
                    exercise. Many
                    people make the errror of performing too much cardio neglecting weightlifting, thinking that only
                    tradmills, stationary
                    bikes, und stair steppers are respondible for buring fat - but this is far from truth.</p>
                <br>
                <p>While cardio will centainly help you burn calories, it's weight training that is going to stimulate
                    the metabolism (so that
                    you become a fatburning machine), change the composition of your body and bring about the shape that
                    you want. I suggest at least
                    three to four days per week lifting weight and four to five perfirning cardio-preferably first thing
                    in the morning or right after
                    resistance training</p>
                <br>
                <p>Moreover, combining both weight training and cardiovascular exercise not only enhances your
                    fat-burning capabilities but also promotes overall health and well-being. Weight training helps
                    build muscle mass, allowing you to burn more calories even when you're not exercising.
                    Cardiovascular exercise, more energized lifestyle. Remember, consistency and proper technique are
                    key to maximizing your results and avoiding injuries.</p>
